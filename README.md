# CardanoTelegramBot

A simple implementation of a Telegram bot for ITIS G. Cardano of Pavia

## INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

The following are the debian package to install to run the project:
```
sudo apt-get install python2.7
sudo apt-get install idle
```

And these are the main necessary python modules:
```
pip install python-telegram-bot
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
pip install pdfminer
```

You can also install all necessary python modules from the requirements file with the following command:
```
pip install -r ./path/to/project/folder/requirements.txt
```

I would also recommend you to install and use python virtual environments, a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places.
```
pip install virtualenv
```

[Here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) are all the docs about.
